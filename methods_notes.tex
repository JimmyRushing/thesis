       In the 10.1002/cphc.201900793 paper it says that the highest ITIC transfer integral 
       is 16Mev. this motivates finding a morphology of itic that is well packed and 
       seeing if out TIs match this. in the transfer-qcc-pluck notebook im goin go 
       have it grab chromos that are near each other and give the TI for them.
    
        I have conscripted gwen and cody to produce rdfs from /home/erjank_project/itic-project/workspace 
        to pick an educated guess of a nice morphology to begin with. that is, a non liquid or frozen one
        at least.

        the guts to achieve this are in the intramolecular notebook

      Going to get some benzene rings from mbuild in some oreintations and get transfer integrals 
      between them. I will call the notebook transfer-qcc-P3HT and i will build the benzenes in 
      new_molecule_test notebook

      evans paper gives TI between .3 and 1 for various conditions ie bonded non-bonded, seperation
      distance etcetera

      instead of specifying the exact angles between thiophenes to compare to evans paper,
      I am going to use fill_box from mbuild to give me a sudo random orientations of two
      thiothenes in a box.

      getting reasonable numbers for thiophenes in terms of homo humo and TI. jenny going to get
      some more sceintifically shifted gsds.
