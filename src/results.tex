\section{Summary}

\indent The computational bottle neck of simulation charge mobility is also the most theoreticaly challenging.
Estimating the TI for each pair of cromophores. A future improvement to MorphCT will be accelerating this step
with Machine learning techniques. Musil et al. have shown that ML could produce a 90 \% decrease in
computationl effort \cite{Musil2018}
\subsection{Improvements}
Dynamic disorder does effect charge mobility (CT in high mobility conjugated polymers) with every pico second
may have a 10-20\% fluxuation in TI. 

In our kmc algorithm we could incorperate the rates of other events like recombination.
