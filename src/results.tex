\section{Summary}

The performance of morphct at the quantum chemical level is explored

Sensitivity testing on benchmark P3HT morphology provided by the Evan and matty work can was finegrained and
used to compare to previous mobility results as well as to test the sensitivity of the algorithm to
reorganization energy, dcut, MSD calculation, and simulation temperature.

On the spot MD simulation of 1000
molecules was performed for testing morph another benchmark OPV material. Janks/mattys work has shown that taking
each monomer to be a chromophore even though charges are known to delocalize on 7 monomers still reproduces
the overall mobility well because the very fast hops along the backbone. I think the application of this
hopping model to ITIC other small molecules is even more justified. Knowing that the this molecule has
negligible electron density in the side chains, chomophores are taking to be the backbone. The effect that
the side chains have on mobility are not a result of electronic contribution to the frontier molecular
orbitals but rather is a result of the effect the chains have on the morphology of the material. 

Delineating chromophores within a morphology needs to be justified by DFT or experiment and balanced against
the computational costs. Furthermore, manually indexing the atoms of the chosen chromophore
remains a significant hurdle. Tutorials on github show how to use the open source tool VMD to speed up this
leg of the workflow. We have also had success with Grits and smarts matching to delineate chromophores through
out the morphology. 

\section{Quantum Chemical Accuracy}

As a first foray into the performance of PySCF, which we outsource our QCC to, we performed two experiments.
As discussed above, QCC are used in two distinct way in our workflow. First it is used to estimate free energy
difference between individual chromophores as the difference in their HOMO(or LUMO) energy level. Secondly, it is
used to estimate the electronic overlap($T_{ij}$) between with the dimer splitting method which involves
calculating the HOMO(or LUMO) of the dimer formed by the two chromophpres. We explored the performance of our
workflow for this calculations in isolation. 

In the first case, at the level of a single chromophore, we calculate the homo-lumo gap for fused ring
oligomers of increasing length. Fused-ring geometries are of particlular interest for accepter
molecules, as discussed for FREAs in the introduction. 
This phenomenon has been studied for fused ring molecules using DFT methods \cite{Arago2010}.
They found that, from length 4 to length 8, the homo-lumo decreased from 5.26eV to 4.92eV. Our INDO implemention overestimates these values but by less than the
factor of 2-3 found in other investigations \cite{Gorelsky2001} \cite{Gorelsky2016}. 
Our results are in \ref{fig:fused}.

To recreate these experiments, using Mbuild \cite{Klein2016}, oligomers composed of 4-8 planar fused thiophene rings
were intialized using the representative smiles strings and the molecules saved to GSD file format. The frontier
molecular orbitals are quantified with the methods outlined in methods and the difference between the energy of the
homo and the lumo of each molecule are plotted in \ref{fig:fused}.
Reproduced in our experiment is the near linear relationship between oligomer length and the magnitude of the
homo-lumo gap.

\begin{figure}
  \center
  \includegraphics[width = .8\textwidth]{figures/fused-ring-figure.png}
  \caption{The difference in energy between the homo and the lumo of fused ring molecules by molecule length}
  \label{fig:fused}
\end{figure}

At the level of the chromophore pair, we explore the effect of angle and distance between two non-bonded
thiophene rings on the calculated $T_{ij}$ between them.
Using Mbuild, a reference thiophene is placed at the origin in the xy-plane
with the y-axis running through the sulfur atom. 
A second thiophene is instantiated as in figure \ref{TIplots}(a)
and allowed a combination of moves wherein it is translated
in the positive z and x direction by up to 5 angstroms 
and rotated up to 90 degrees about its y-axis. Center-to-center distances less
than 3 angstroms are disallowed as distances shorter than this are considered
unphysical. The $T_{ij}$ resulting from these 4300 unique orientations are shown in figure \ref{TIplots}(b). The figure shows that, as expected, a
decrease in 
center-to-center distance results in more orbital overlap and thus an increase in $T_{ij}$. Also observable in the figure is that
a rotation about the x-axis orients the sulfer downward, resulting in a smaller sulfer-to-sulfler distance 
and a greater $T_{ij}$. 

In a similar work using a random forest machine learning to predict $T_{ij}$
between thiophenes based on 9 input features, the authors found that the
features of most importance for predicting $T_{ij}$ was bonded vs non bonded,
center to center distance and rotation about the y-axis. \cite{Jankowski2019c}

    this would appear at the origin of figure (b)}

Graduating these pairwise energetics to charge characteristics on the scale of MD simulations
requires the use of an iterative algorithm. For this we employ KMC simulations.

The results in \ref{table:nonlin} for PySCF were run with a dcut 12. With dcut 10, the crystalline mobility
moves to .15 which is closer to mattys. Waiting on the dcut 10 for the others (semi and disordered). Im very
curious was that will do to their mobilities. All this exploration tells me the workflow is almost two
different things for highly conjugated polyers than it is for amorphous materials. Could a higher dcut in the
semi and amorphous actual make for a slower mobility? I feel like the current numbers are better also. That is
closer to experimentally observed numbers. need more data!!!


\section{MorphCT Sensitivity}

The sensitivity of the algorithm to various parameter was performed on the benchmark crystalline P3HT
morphology.

\subsection{Neighbor Cutoff (dcut)}

Voronoi analysis allows for the computationally efficient partitioning of space into
polyhedra chromophore cells. In this context, chromophore $i$ is the neighbor of chromophore $j$ if they
share a boundary with one another. An artifact of constructing nieghborlists in this way is that some
neighbors are too far apart to interact electronically, but are nevertheless closer to each other than they
are to any other chromophores. 
This phenomena is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:dcut} 

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{dcut sensitivity}

\hline %inserts single line
\end{tabular}
\label{table:dcut-sense} % is used to refer this table in the text
\end{table}


With each chromophore pair requiring a relatively costly QCC, after narrowing down the chromophore pairs with voronoi, it
could be
computationally preferable to calculate the distances between all pairs and remove neighbors more than dcut
apart. We can see in table \ref{table:dcut-sense}, that with dcut = 10 we get comparable mobilities to the
dcut 12 simulation with $10^5$ less
pairs, which could suggest that beyond dcut 10 there is a diminishing returns on mobility prediction with the
additional chromophores. However, we found for the materials currently under investigation, PySCF is speedy enough such that intrucing dcut adds more ambiguity
into the workflow than is necessary given that the average time per QCC dimer calculation is .036s for P3HT and
1.2s for ITIC. Furthermore, with MorphCT acting on static atomistic oreintations, these calculations 
are only necessarily performed once per morphology. With that, our workflow defaults this cutoff distance to half
the length of the simulation box, rendering it effectively moot. 

If, in the future, more computationally expensive methods are incorperated into the QCC step, or chromophores in other
organic materials are a heavier lift PySCF, it could be benificial to reintroduce this cutoff distance. The optimal dcut will vary depending on the material and before doing large sweeping analysis on a new
material its at a discount to do some preliminary analysis to determine an apporiate value. We tested the
sensitivity of the algorithm to the value (dcut). The [zoomed figure] Shows a example dcut radaii. Note that
the z-direction has been collapsed, and the distances do not necessarily correlate to the distance
between chromophores in the system. The figure shows the effect of cutoff distance on value of
16 calculated mobility.

  \label{fig:dcut}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Reorganization energy}

Marcus's nonadiabatic electron transfer theory allows us to model charge transfer as two
intersecting parabolic potential energy surfaces. In this work, the parabalas represent the potential energy surface
of the dimer created by a pair of chomophores with a charge injected on either chromophore. In this context, 
reorganization energy, $\lambda_{ij}$, constitutes the energy required to distort the dimer's equilibrium geometry with a
charge on chromophore $i$ into the dimers equillibrium geometry with charge on chromophore $j$.
Reorganization energy consist of the energy change associated with the destortion of the dimers geometry,
and the distortion of the surrounding medium in responce the movement of the charge. It can be written as
follows:
\begin{align}
    \lambda_{total} = \lambda_{internal} + \lambda_{external}.
\end{align} 
$\lambda = 0.3eV$ is chosen to be the default reorganization energy ($\lambda_{internal} = 0.1eV$
and $\lambda_{external} = .02eV$) as others have done with P3HT \cite{jones2017} and
a flourene-triphenylamine copolymer, TFB \cite{Gali2017}.

    rate accros the morphology and thus the charge mobiility.}
\label{reorg}
\end{figure}

Reorganization energy has a strong effect on charge mobility in organic
molecules[REFS]. In our workflow, reorganization energy is set as an attribute
to the chomophore object. It is defaulted to $~300meV$ as for all chromophore
objects. To test the sensitivity of the algorithm to this value we ran 8
simulations with chromophores assigned reorganization energies of 100-800meV.

\subsection{Temperature}

Another parameter of interest in the Marcus theory mention above is temperature. To test the sensitivity to
temperature, 15 KMC simulations from 100K to 800k were run on the benchmark P3HT crystalline morphology. It
is clear from the results in figure \ref{TEMP}(A) that the mobilities trend upward with temperature. With relatively
weak electronic coupling ($T_{ij}$) between chromophores, electron transfer proceeds nonadiabatically
\cite{clarke2010}. With this weak coupling, the temperature in the Gibbs free energy of activation term
dominates the effect temperature has hop rate.

An unanticipated result is that increasing the temperature of the KMC
simulation also increases the wall time that the simulations required to
complete. As an illustration of why this is the case, the distribution of hop
rates is plotted for 100K and 800K in figure \ref{TEMP}(C)(D). With the distribution of hop rates skewed
drastically higher at 800K, each charge carrier will experience orders of
magnitude more hops during its specified lifetime. 

If extremely cold
temperatures are to be investigates in the future, thought should probably be given to
the decreasing contribution to statistical significance from the addition of
any single charge carrier.

\subsection{MSD (lifetimes)}

The KMC algorithm allows an explicit calculation of the MSD accross a large number of 
particles in the system. Repeating along relevant time scales for 
charge transfer, the slope of this relationship
can be estimated and related to to the 3D diffusion coeffiecient as discussed in the methods section of this
work. Using the Einstien relation (2.3), 
the groundwork for which Einstein derived in his doctoral dissertaion, finally the zero-field
mobility can be obtained. 

It is critical that we not include the ballistic transport timescale in the approximation of the limit
if the slope as time goes to infinity \cite{Maginn2018}. Estimating an upperbound for lifetimes such that
we can estimate the slope of the MSD as time goes to infinity can be messy. In real systems, free chrage
carrier lifetime is subject to a complex interplay between geminate recombination, non-geminate recombination,
charge trapping, temperature, and charge density, whose dynamics play out accros a picosecond to microsecond
timescales and vary widly form material to material as well as from microstrtucture to microstrucute for a
given material \cite{Laquai2015}.

For this work, the primary strategy was to avoid the ballistic region while exploring lifetimes
that are achievable computationally. For example, in an attempt to simulate out to the physical limit, a
simulation a microsecond($10^{-6}s$) lifetime resulted in a single hole hopping for 9 wall time hours.
It is advised that a preanalysis to determine where a given morphology's MSD will convergeb be performed so as
to never simulate past that point. Doing so is superflous and could introduce unessacery noise into the data. 

In the previous work on these P3HT morphologies, 7 liftimes were chosen and a linear regression was performed
to estimate the slope of the MSD. The current work found that the mobility can be apporpriately reproduced
with an appropriate choice of 2 lifetimes beyond the ballistic transport timescale. It was found that with the 
squared displacement averaged over 1000 holes at $10^{-9}s$ and again $10^{-10}s$ the slope of the MSD can be
commensurety reproduced with 1000's less individual holes having to be simulated. The results in the accuracy
section above were aquired with these 2 chosen lifetimes. I am currently running accross 7 lifetimes on the
crystalline morph. 

\begin{figure}
  \center
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/lifetime.png} 
    \caption{The results of running 5 KMC simulations with the first lifetimes as described in the text. It
    can be seen that below the the ballistic timescale (roughly $10^{-10}$), the resulting mobility is affected}
  \label{lifetime}
\end{figure}

With the slope between MSD at the first lifetime and at the second lifetime proving an estimate of the slope
of the MSD, 6 simulations we run with progressiveily shorter first lifetimes. That is, the second lifetime was
set to $10^{-8}s$ for all 5 simulations and the first lifetime was set to $10^{-9}s$, $10^{-10}s$,
$10^{-11}s$, $10^{-12}s$, and $10^{-13}s$ respectively. The results are plotted in figure
\ref{lifetime}. As expected, as the first lifetime progresses in the ballistic transport timescale, which this work
estimates around $10^{-10}s$, the resulting mobility increases. If the starting lifetime is even shorter the
workflow breaks down becuase as can be seen from the hop rate distribution in figure \ref{TEMP}(D), even at
extreme temperatures, holes need more time that that to hop even once. 

Interestingly, the algorithm seems to be quite robust against choice of lifetimes. As can be seen in the
figure, order of magnitude differences in lifetime choices results in less than 2X difference in the resulting
mobility. This further suggests that going lifetime crazy is a waste of computation.  

\section{ITIC}

To explore the extensibility of the workflow on another benchmark OPV material, using planckton-flow, a 1000
molecule morphology of ITIC was equillibrated over a 10e-7 step MD simulation at room temperature. From the results of the MD
simulation, the last frame of the atomic trajectories is taken to represent an accruate equalibrium geometry
of ITIC. The purpose of this work isnt to justify the efficacy of this type of molecular simulation but it has
been used to affect elsewhere[REFS].

To apply the hopping model to this atomistic morphology requires the
delineation of segments within the morphology upon which charges can delocalize along the within a the HOMO(or in
the case of LUMO for the acceptor). It should be noted that acceptor in this context doesn't refer to
chomophore $j$ as such. Rather, when investigating molecules relevent to electronic devices, acceptors are the
organic analogue of p-type inorganic semiconductors and donors the analogue of the n-type. 
 The LUMO of ITIC delocalizes along the backbone of the molecule, with
negligible electron density in the side chains. This has been quantified using DFT and well visualized at the
level of the molecule by Han et al \cite{Han2019}. We have visualized this at the nanometer scale in figure \ref{ITIC} using the openly
available visualization tool OVITO \cite{Stukowski2010a}. This makes the the backbone of this kind of small molecule
material the obvious choice. In more polymeric materials like P3HT, the hopping model has received further
justification elsewhere. 

\begin{figure}[]

\end{subfigure}
    \caption[short]{1000 molecule ITIC morphology. Right: Segments known to participate in frontier
    molecular orbitals are in color and side chains in black.}
\label{ITIC}
\end{figure}



The the reported
experimental electron mobility of ITIC varies depending on how it was processed and how it was measured. Time-of-flight electron mobilities on the order of $10^{-4}$ \cite{Mica2018} and field effect mobilities on the order of
$10^{-2}$ \cite{Park2018} have been reported. 

A single molecule ITIC has 186 atoms, with the backbone consisting of 70 atoms. We deployed two different
approaches to the delineation of chomophores within the ITIC morphology. In addition the the simulation of hopping
from backbone to backbone we ran simulations with the whole molecule prescibed as chromophores. This
necessarily requires more heavy lifting from PySCF but is trivially easy from an indexing perspective. Similar to the results of the DCUT
investigation, this implemenation of PySCF combined with clever pickling of system objects at various stages
of the workflow suggest that the laborious delineation of chromophores either via manual perscription or
by clever use of smarts matching is a fools errand. We found that, while the 70 atom chomophores took 1.2s
per dimer while the whole molecule dimer calculations with 186 atoms per chomophore to on average 3.3s.
Comprable mobilities of $(1.019 \pm 0.001)\cdot 10^{-3}$ or the backbone chromophores and 
$(1.275 \pm 0.001)\cdot 10^{-3}$ [rerunning this because it got over written] for the whole molecule. 

For small molecule materials this suggests forgoing labor intinsive indexing of chromophores.

As discussed in the sensitivit analysis, our mobility calcualtions are relatively sensitive to the choice of
reorganization energy. For ITIC, $\lambda_{internal}$ has been well investigated and is widely reported as
$~0.15eV$. The external reorganization is harder to estimate. We take $\lambda_{total}=0.3eV$ as we did for
P3HT. With the fused
backbone resulting in a higher internal contribution and the lack of long range order resulting in a lower
external contribution. 

\section{Improvements}

In this work, we ignore dynamic disorder by doing calculations on snapshots from equillibrium MD simulations.
Others have had success intruducing dynamic disorder via nudging the QQC calculated TI value at every
iteration of the KMC algorithm by a number drawn randomly from a Gaussian Distribtion \cite{Gali2017}.

Dynamic disorder does effect charge mobility (CT in high mobility conjugated polymers) with every pico second
may have a 10-20\% fluxuation in TI. Need to find the paper but using the dynamic dimer methor for TI calc
could be a way to introduce dynamic disorder. Or it could be done as mentioned before in another paper where
they use two different methods one with a guassians fluxuation and sime ohther fancy method. 

In our kmc algorithm we could incorperate the rates of other events like recombination.

The computational bottle neck of simulation charge mobility is also the most theoretically challenging.
Estimating the TI for each pair of chromophores. A future improvement to MorphCT will be accelerating this step
with Machine learning techniques. Musil et al. have shown that ML could produce a 90 \% decrease in
computational effort \cite{Musil2018}

Something to do is allow morphct as to figure out what to do with donor accpeter mixtures. It would be pretty
easy to run asyncronously on the donor/acceptor materials and compare. this could be a measure of morphology.
If you run pure donor and pure acceptor and you got mobities, if on of those drops in the mixed morph more
that the other you probably dont have a nice domain for BHJ.

I hope one day a submission to a quantum computer could solve with extreme precicission the shrodinger
equation for an entire morphology. Quantum algorithms are most advanced in this space and we await the race
to large qubit computers. 

I havent looked into it but I think reorganization energry should scale in out algorythm with crystallinity
iasfaras we can measure crystallinity. the external reorganization energy of the material ,at least for p3ht
was 200, and thats the lions share of overall reorganization energy which we have all ready shown to
monitonically scale with the calculated mobilioty in this algorith. But external reorganization energy is
related to the distortion of the surrounding medium. if the surrounding medium is shaped like a net if will
certainly distort less than a disordered medium. Maybe this all ready talked about but energy does scale with
molucaler size and rigidity \cite{McMahon2010a}
