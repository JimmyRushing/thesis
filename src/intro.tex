\chapter{Introduction}
Morphologies were obtained via in house software (see github for planckton-flow).
The fuel for the simulation engines mentioned above(plankton-flow/hoomd) utilized in this work is the generalized Amber force field (GAFF) \cite{Wang2004a}
The Amber forcefield was designed for use in modeling protein and nucleic acid systems. 
Serendipitously, the generalized Amber forcefield has parameters for organic molecules comprised of H,C,N,O, and P and
produces accurate simulations of organic molecules for use in OPVs. 
BHJ OSC work in 4 steps . photoabsorbtions, exciton diffusion, CT , Charge diffusion. \citet{Fusella2019}
Our work focuses on stage four. It has been show that the hole/electron of both donor and 
acceptor material are relavant to overall device performance. \cite{Wang2019e}. Something about if electron mobililty it too high in acceptor vs the 
hole mobility in the donor. It gets clogged up and you get nongeminate recombination loss  Also, imbalanced charge-carrier
mobility can lead to space-charge build up in the low mobilty material that can screen the built in field.
