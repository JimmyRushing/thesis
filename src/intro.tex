\chapter{Introduction} 
\indent Organic semiconductors have a niche to fill across the landscape of electronic
device manufacturing due to the flexibility, processability, and cost of manufacturing. They have all ready
achieved commercial viability in the OFET, OLED space NEED REFS. They are of interest to a vast array of
advance material engineering. These materials can
provide stretchability, self-healing, and biodegradability for next generation medical devices
\cite{Brutting2006}.  Morphologies were obtained via in house software (see github for planckton-flow).  The
fuel for the simulation engines mentioned above(plankton-flow/hoomd) utilized in this work is the generalized
Amber force field (GAFF)\cite{Wang2004a} The Amber forcefield was designed for use in modeling protein and
nucleic acid systems.  Serendipitously, the generalized Amber forcefield has parameters for organic molecules
comprised of H,C,N,O, and P and produces accurate simulations of organic molecules for use in OPVs.  

BHJ OSC work in 4 steps . photoabsorbtions, exciton diffusion, CT , Charge diffusion. \citet{Fusella2019}.
Engineering the active layer of an OSC from organic materials presents distinct challenges and advantages at
all four stages. Achieving effecient photoabsorbtion in the OPV active layer requires designing donor and
acceptor molecules with high absorbtion in the most abundant region of the solar spectrum. An example
of an advantage of excitonic photoabsorbtion is that, absortion takes place in a narrow peak of roughly 300nm.
This allows for the ability to tune the active layer material to absorb radiation in just above or below the
visible spectrum (into the NIR or UV spectrum respectiviely). This, along with solution processability, 
could allow for the production of windows that passively draw current. Semi-transparent OSCs have all ready
reached 11 \% efficeincy. \cite{Brabec2020}

\newline \indent Our work
focuses on stage four. It has been show that the hole/electron of both donor and acceptor material are
relavant to overall device performance. \cite{Wang2019e}.  Something about if electron mobililty it too high
in acceptor vs the hole mobility in the donor. It gets clogged up and you get nongeminate recombination loss
Also, imbalanced charge-carrier mobility can lead to space-charge build up in the low mobilty material that
can screen the built in field.  \cite{Bartelt2015}. shown by space charge limited current experiments
\cite{Small2013}.

Over the past 20 years the PCE has gone from blah to blah. Reaching 17 \% effeciency in these devices requires
rigerous and time consuming theory that must be then chemically synthesized and tested. Researchers have to
balance the optimiztion of electron structures of candidate donor/acceptor materials against the miscibility
of two candidate molecules as well as the resultant morphology across the thermodynamic landscape of
variuos solution processes which ultimately govern the Jsc and FF of at the device level \cite{Zhu2020a}. 
With this immensity of parameter space involved in the design of BHJ material, it is desirable that a modular
open-source pipeline exhist for simulating the morphology of candidate molecules as well as simulating the 
associated charge charecteristics. 

\newline \indent Jones and Jankowski provided just such a pipeline. Version one of MorphCT was capable of
connecting qualitativley the morphological features produced by MD simulations. However, it was determined
that in the interest of reprducabitilty, it was critical to "containerize" this pipeline. Until as recently as
the past few years it was common place to not publish code with the results of computational works. Containers
are virtual machines that contain all the dependencies, configurations, code and data necessary to reproduce
results. \cite{Cito2016a}
