BHJ OSC work in 4 steps . photoabsorbtions, exciton diffusion, CT , Charge diffusion. \citet{Fusella2019}
Out work focuses on stage for. It has been show that the hole/electron of both donor and 
acceptor material are relavant to overall device performance. \cite{Wang2019e}. Something about if electron mobililty it too high in acceptor vs the 
hole mobility in the donor. It gets clogged up and you get nongeminate recombination loss  Also, imbalanced charge-carrier
mobility can lead to space-charge build up in the low mobilty material that can screen the built in field.
\cite{Bartelt2015}. shown by space charge limited current experiments  \cite{Small2013}.
