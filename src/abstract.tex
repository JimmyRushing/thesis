Organic photovoltaics are a rapidly advancing class of materials that can provide unique functionalities for
electronic device engineering.
All conjugated molecules can conduct charge. 
However, molecular engineering for a particular device design
requires selecting for optimal metrics across an array of tuning parameter that include but are
not limited to the following: processability, ionization potential, electron affinity, permitivitty. 
Wetlab screening of materials across
this vast parameter space is prohibitive of time, cost, and creativity. 
In this work, we outline a computational, open-source, simulation pipeline that can serve as a 
virtual laboratory for the screening of organic photovoltaic materials. 
Through the development of Planckton and MorphCT, convenience packages for facilitating molecular dynamics
simulations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of OPVs respectively, we attempt to grate the learning curve
associated with materials simualtion. We test the pipeline on
two of the most well researched OPV materials for organic solar cell design and develop methods for deploying
the pipeline with open-source software engineering priniciples in mind.

Putting the chemist names for P3HT and ITIC so i can refernce later. Maybe this is an SI thing

ITIC
2,2'-[[6,6,12,12-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-6,12-dihydro-dithieno[2,3-d:2',3'-d']-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b']dithiophene-2,8-diyl]bis[methylidyne(3-oxo-1H-indene-2,1(3H)-diylidene)]]bis[propanedinitrile]

P3HT poly(3-hexylthiophene)
