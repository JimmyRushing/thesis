    havent looked into the methods but it looks like they are getting around .1 for their transfer
    integrals and thats what we are getting as well.  TABLE 4

    In table four these guys show that the theoretical mobility overestimates mobility 
    compared to the experimental value. Our current mobility results are in the range of
    the theoretical overestimate. But if this represents an accurate marcus theoretical
    limit it can still be relevant comparatively?

    they say time of flight mobility in p3ht is roughly the same for holes and 
    electrons at ~3.8 *10^{-4}
